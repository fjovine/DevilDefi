The aim is that of getting the largest number of fruits before the devil fills the inner square.
Toss dice to get a fruit but you can get the devil which will occupy the inner square or if you are lucky you get a basket for two fruits.

When the fruits are over, the player(s) having more fruits wins.
The devil wins if it fills the inner square.

Enjoy !
